1. Brief Description of the Artifact
The artifact I chose for my ePortfolio is the Grocery Store Item Tracker, a command-line application initially developed in C++ during my CS-210 Programming Languages course. Created on August 11, 2023, this program reads a list of grocery items from a text file, tracks the frequency of each item, and provides options for users to view item frequencies and a frequency histogram. The project was my introduction to data handling in C++, covering foundational concepts such as file I/O, frequency mapping, and user interaction through a menu-driven interface.
2. Justification for Including the Artifact
I selected the Grocery Store Item Tracker for my ePortfolio because it effectively showcases my skills in software engineering and adaptability to new languages and design principles. The original artifact demonstrates my ability to:
•	Handle data using maps (equivalent to dictionaries in Python).
•	Structure code modularly to promote clarity and future scalability.
•	Implement user-friendly features, like frequency tracking and histogram display.
The enhancement involved porting the program to Python, improving its readability and usability by adopting Pythonic conventions and implementing a case-insensitive search. This transformation underscores my adaptability in software development, highlighting my ability to transition a project between languages while preserving and enhancing its functionality.
3. Meeting Course Outcomes
The enhancement aligned with the course outcomes I set out to achieve in Module One, including:
•	Designing effective computing solutions: Porting the C++ code to Python required me to evaluate and restructure the original design, managing trade-offs between language-specific features while retaining core functionality.
•	Implementing secure coding practices: During the enhancement, I added error handling for file operations to ensure the program could manage potential runtime issues gracefully.
•	Using well-founded tools and techniques: The port to Python gave me the opportunity to apply Python’s powerful standard libraries and simplify tasks that were more verbose in C++, such as file handling and dictionary operations.
I believe these improvements reinforce my understanding of modular design and error handling, meeting the goals I set for this milestone.
4. Reflection on the Enhancement Process
The enhancement process from C++ to Python was both challenging and rewarding. I learned to adopt Python’s design conventions, emphasizing readability and simplicity. One of the main challenges was translating C++-specific constructs, like maps, into their Python equivalents while preserving the integrity of the original design. Additionally, I enhanced the user experience by implementing a case-insensitive search, which required me to rethink how data was stored and retrieved.
Overall, this project deepened my understanding of modular design, file handling, and error management across languages. It also strengthened my problem-solving skills as I navigated the differences between C++ and Python. This artifact not only represents my proficiency in software development but also my commitment to refining and evolving my skills, making it a meaningful addition to my ePortfolio.
